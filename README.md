# Reinforcement Learning
Following the [excellent course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html) of the University College of London (UCL) on reinforcement learning ([the videos of the course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ) are the best that I have found on Reinforcement Learning). I really suggest watching the videos but also reading the [Reinforcement Learning Bible from Barto & Sutton](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf): their last edition of 2018 contains new insights about the latest accomplishements (before 2018 obviously) on TD Gammon, Samuel's Checkers, AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero that are really worth your dedication.

# Architecture
## Lessons
Following the lessons of the UCL I implemented some of the situations presented in the lessons so as to check my personal understanding of reinforcement learning. And this is how I will organize this folder: For each lesson I will present my codes that implement the class examples. The goal here is therefore to complete the lecture using my personal scripts.
## Personal extentions
Using my newly acquired experience I applied reinforcement learning to some cases of my own to check if it was able to solve some environements. Some of the environement come from [gym](https://gym.openai.com/) some others were environements I coded.

# About
I don't claim to be a reinforcement learning expert, but following these courses and reading some main references really made me see that there was a different way to solve lots of everyday optimization problems. It showed me that human policies are not optimal in every domain and that reinforcement provides a way to learn the best way of dealing with a problem. We only tell our algorithm what it has to accomplish, we don't tell it how to do it: we have to give up on our every prebuilt ideas.
