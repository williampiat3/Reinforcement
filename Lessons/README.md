# Lessons
Here is are my notes concerning the lessons of that I followed on reinforcement learning I will present in the READMEs all the key notions of the lessons (which, in my opinion, are already dense enough) and in each lesson I'll provide the codes that I did it order to understand better the course. I will put some links for the lesson so as to link my notes to the content, I do this only because the content that I am commenting is publicly available. I offer my apologies if I am making a poor use of this amazing content. ;)
